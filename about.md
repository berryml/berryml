My mathematical interests are primarily in Differential Topology and the topology of low-dimensional manifolds. As a data scientist, I'm most interesed in computer vision, localization and mapping, and edge analytics but I'm not too technically picky. Lately, I've been fascinated by applying AI/ML on RF data.

## Currently...
