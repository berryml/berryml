What is infinity?

We say that there are infinitely many numbers between 0 and 1. Just as there are infinitely many numbers between 0 and 2. And it's the same amount of infinity. It's just infinity.

This is strange and unsatisfying.

In mathematics, there are two components to the concept of infinity - countability and measure.
